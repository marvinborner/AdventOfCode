# Welcome!

This repository mostly contains ugly overcomplicated spaghetti code
solving the **Advent Of Code** questions in a reasonable amount of time
and computing power.

## Languages

Most of my solutions are written in C but you may also find some in C#,
JS or Python.

You can find my `bruijn` solutions
[here](https://github.com/marvinborner/bruijn/tree/main/samples/aoc/).
